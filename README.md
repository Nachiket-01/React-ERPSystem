#ERP System Frontend with React

This project aims to create a simplified interface for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system using React. The system includes key pages such as Dashboard, Products Management, Orders Management, and Orders Calendar View. The frontend part of this application is developed entirely with React, with no backend implementation required.

Project Overview
The ERP system consists of the following pages:

Dashboard: Provides an overview of key metrics or features and quick navigation links to other sections.
Products Management: Allows management of product listings including adding, editing, and deleting products.
Orders Management: Facilitates viewing orders with details like order ID, customer name, order date, and status. Optionally, allows viewing order details, updating order status, and deletion of orders.
Orders Calendar View: Displays orders on their expected delivery dates in a calendar view, with the ability to view all orders due for delivery on a specific day.
