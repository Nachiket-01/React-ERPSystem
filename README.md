#ERP System Frontend with React

This project aims to create a simplified interface for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system using React. The system includes key pages such as Dashboard, Products Management, Orders Management, and an optional feature, Orders Calendar View. The frontend part of this application is developed entirely with React, with no backend implementation required.
